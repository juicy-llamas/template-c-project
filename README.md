# template-c-project
This is a sort-of template environment for a C project. It has (will have maybe more) a number of helpful logging macros, a custom makefile with a handy testing utility, and (probably most notably) the ability to create data driven tests using python (pytest.py). It might also include some functions that I write rather consistently, ex. an argument parser.

This project does not fill any particular aim or niche, though, and is primarily for my own use. May have bugs, and I'm sure there would be a lot of desired functionality to be implemented. You can let me know via my email (demoylan dot work at_symbol gmail dot com) or make an issue if you use this code and feel that a specific feature should be implemented.

**This is not a CMake project and I have no plans on making it as such.** I would have to learn CMake more first, and at that point, I might as well just make a whole other cross-platform template from scratch. Also, given that, **this is Unix only** without support for Windows (it might support mac because I use `sh` in the Makefile.
